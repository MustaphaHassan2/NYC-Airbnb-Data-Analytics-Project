NYC-Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Project
Exploratory data analysis and insights from New York City Airbnb listings using Python. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and trend discovery to understand pricing, availability, and neighbourhood patterns.

Let me know if you'd like to include tools used (like Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) or a sentence about business implications.
